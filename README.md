# life-expectancy-prediction
This project is a life expectancy prediction system that uses linear regression to predict life expectancy based on various factors such as adult mortality, alcohol consumption, percentage expenditure, Hepatitis B, Measles, Body Mass Index (BMI), Polio, total expenditure, Diphtheria, HIV/AIDS, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, income composition of resources, and schooling. The model is deployed on the web using Flask.<br>This project is a life expectancy prediction system that uses linear regression to predict life expectancy based on various factors such as adult mortality, alcohol consumption, percentage expenditure, Hepatitis B, Measles, Body Mass Index (BMI), Polio, total expenditure, Diphtheria, HIV/AIDS, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, income composition of resources, and schooling.

# Usage
To use this life expectancy prediction system, clone the repository and run the Flask app using the following commands:
```
npm i
npm run dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Then, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser. Enter the required input values and click on the "Predict" button. The predicted life expectancy value will be displayed on the screen.<br><br>

# Dataset<br>
The Life_Expectancy_Data.csv file used in this project is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)<br><br>
